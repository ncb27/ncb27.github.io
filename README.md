## Projects
### Predicción de cancelación de clientes
[Publication](https://github.com/ncb27/proyecto_final.git)

This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict churn in a telecommunications company. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed, data was preprocessed and several models were tested, including Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost. The oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to handle class imbalance. The final model selected was Random Forest, with an F1-score of 0.9081 and an ROC AUC of 0.9696, which will allow the company to anticipate cancellations and take measures to retain customers.

### Data visualization 
[Publication](https://proyect-b685.onrender.com)

This project will create a histogram and a scatter plot with the vehicles_us file.

### Predictive Modeling and Data Protection in Insurance Benefits

In this project, I analyzed customer data from an insurance company to solve different machine learning tasks. First, I used kNN to predict whether a customer would receive insurance benefits and compared its performance with a dummy model. Then, I applied linear regression to predict the amount of benefits and evaluated its performance with RMSE and R^2. Next, I implemented a data obfuscation method using matrix transformation to protect customers' personal information. Finally, I demonstrated analytically and in code that obfuscation does not affect the quality of linear regression.
